* Participants and Activities

These variables are used to identify the person performing activity of daily living (ADL) as well as the activity type.
-	Participants: the participant -Subject ID 
-	Activity: string activity name: 
 Walking
 Walking Upstairs
 Walking Downstairs
 Sitting
 Standing
 Laying

* Measurements on the mean and standard deviation.

There are 180 observations (30 subjects times 6 activities) and 81 columns (1 for participants, 1 for activity and 78 for aggregated features related to mean and std. The full list is:
